# 🌀 Hybrid R + Python Quarto Template

This project demonstrates a reproducible workflow combining R, Python (via Conda), and Quarto (.qmd notebooks).  

It is designed for users who want to mix R and Python in one project while maintaining clean, version-controlled environments.

A ready-to-use, reproducible template for hybrid data science workflows using:

- **R** for statistical computing and visualization (via `renv`)
- **Python** for ML and data wrangling (via Conda + `reticulate`)
- **Quarto** to author `.qmd` notebooks that mix both languages seamlessly

---
## 🔧 Prerequisites

- R (≥ 4.0) and RStudio
- Python (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- Quarto CLI (optional, for command-line render)

|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `initialize_project.R` | One-click setup for R and Python environments   |
| `setup_conda_env.R`    | Creates and activates the Conda environment     |
| `renv.lock` (optional) | Pins R packages (auto-generated by `renv`)      |
| `environment.yml` (optional) | Pins Python packages (auto-generated)   |
| `example.qmd`          | Minimal R + Python test document                |
| `_quarto.yml`          | Enables Python interop and custom Quarto config |
| `.gitignore`           | Standard ignore rules                           |

## 🧭 How to Use This Template

Click **"Use this template"** at the top of this repo to create a new project repository.  
Then:

### 1. Clone your new repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-new-project.git
cd your-new-project
```
Alternatively, just clone it directly from the GitHub website. You may want to replace the README file with your own. To avoid conflicts, leave the box asking you to add a README file unchecked. Once you have cloned this repository, you can create your own README and re-name this file. 

### 2. Set Up as an RStudio Project

After cloning or downloading this repo:

1. Open RStudio  
2. Go to **File > New Project > Existing Directory**  
3. Choose this project folder  
4. RStudio will create an `.Rproj` file and open the project in a clean, scoped environment  

### 3. Initialize the environment

Once inside your .Rproj in RStudio run in the console:

```r
source("initialize_project.R")
```

This will:
- Install required R packages
- Restore R package versions with `renv`
- Set up or activate the Python environment via Conda
- Install needed Python packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, etc.)

> Not using Python? Just set `use_python <- FALSE` at the top of `initialize_project.R`.

---

## 🧪 Test It

Render the included notebook:

```bash
quarto render example.qmd
```

It will execute both R and Python chunks.

---

## 🧩 Customization Tips

- Add your own R or Python packages using:
  ```r
  ensure_python_package("your-package")
  ```
- Run `export_conda_env()` to update `environment.yml`
- Run `renv::snapshot()` to update `renv.lock`
- Add your data to `/data`, scripts to `/scripts`, notebooks to `/analysis`

---

## 🏷 Versioning and Reproducibility

- Track changes to `initialize_project.R` and `setup_conda_env.R`
- Use GitHub Releases to version your template (`v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.)
- Encourage users to pin and snapshot environments for full reproducibility

---

## 🔁 Updating and Sharing Your Environment

### After installing/updating Python packages:

```r
export_conda_env()
```
This overwrites `environment.yml` with your current Conda environment.

### After installing/updating R packages:

```r
renv::snapshot()
```
This updates `renv.lock` so collaborators get the same R setup.

---

## 📁 Key Dependency Files

- `environment.yml` – lists Python/Conda packages
- `renv.lock` – pins your R package versions
- `.gitignore` – filters out system and local clutter
- `initialize_project.R` – one-stop script to bootstrap your setup
